## Pay Attention!!!

- **INDIVIDUAL** evaluation
- Watch out for academic dishonesty:
    - SELF-EVALUATION: A self-evaluation that does not match the material delivered will be interpreted as academic dishonesty;
    - PLAGIARISM: Activities that involve online research can be enriched with citations from various sources. However, whenever you use text or images that are not yours, your work must be accompanied by a "references" section. Just use the hyperlinks used;
    - COPYING WORKS: It is not allowed to exchange works between groups, each group is responsible for the intellectual development of the project. Do not copy and submit another student's work, and do not allow your work to be copied. Duplicated activities will result in the cancellation of both.

- The student must implement the project based on the presented rubric;
- The student must fill out the evaluation form provided by the professor;
- The student must upload the code to a Github repository.
